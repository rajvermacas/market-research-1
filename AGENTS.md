## Working agreement

Whenever I point out or you catch yourself repeating same mistakes again, before continuing add it as a rule in #LESSONS below to avoid it in future

## Project

Market research and systematic trading work on the Indian equity market (NSE).

- **Data**: daily OHLCV for every NSE main-board listing, 2000 to date, stored as year-partitioned
  Parquet under `data/`. Only the daily panel is committed — hourly/weekly/monthly would triple the
  repository size, and weekly/monthly are derivable from daily by resampling.
- **Engine**: [Polars](https://pola.rs) is the dataframe library of choice. Prefer `pl.scan_parquet`
  + lazy expressions over eager pandas-style code.
- **Purpose**: data analysis, trade strategy research, and backtesting.

## Layout

```
data/universe/nse_universe.parquet        every NSE symbol -> company, series, ISIN, listing date,
                                          industry, and Nifty index membership flags
data/ohlcv/daily/year=*/data.parquet      symbol, date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, volume
data/ohlcv/_coverage_daily.csv            per-symbol bar counts and date ranges
data/ohlcv/_manifest.json                 provenance of the current snapshot + known caveats
scripts/download_market_data.py           (re)builds the universe and every price panel
scripts/validate_data.py                  structural, quality and cross-interval checks
```

## Conventions

- Prices live in **long format** (one row per symbol/bar), not wide. Keep it that way — it is what
  Polars group-by/window expressions want.
- Column names are lowercase snake_case. Intraday panels use a tz-aware `datetime`
  (`Asia/Kolkata`); daily/weekly/monthly use a `date`. `volume` is `pl.Int64`.
- Every panel is partitioned as `year=YYYY/data.parquet` so no file approaches GitHub's 100 MB
  limit. Read with `pl.scan_parquet("data/ohlcv/<interval>/**/*.parquet", hive_partitioning=True)`.
- Parquet is written with `zstd` compression.
- Refreshing data is `python scripts/download_market_data.py --interval daily`; it rewrites the
  interval directory from scratch. Batches are checkpointed under `.cache/` so an interrupted run
  resumes; `--fresh` ignores them.
- Do not commit hourly/weekly/monthly panels. The downloader can still produce them on request.
- After changing anything that touches the data files, run `python scripts/validate_data.py`.
- `_manifest.json` is the source of truth for snapshot stats. Do not hard-code row counts in prose
  that will silently go stale — point at the manifest.

## Known data caveats

Read these before drawing conclusions from a backtest:

0. **The early years are thin.** The panel is dated from 2000 but holds only ~9% of the symbols
   that actually traded in 2000, rising to ~75% by 2008 and ~90% after 2020. Do not treat pre-2004
   results as market-wide. Curing this needs NSE bhavcopy (see below), not more Yahoo requests.
1. **Survivorship bias.** The universe is NSE's *current* main-board listing, so pre-snapshot
   delistings are absent.
2. **Adjustments.** `open/high/low/close` are split-adjusted; `adj_close` is also dividend-adjusted.
   Use `adj_close` (or the `adj_close / close` ratio) for total-return work.
3. **Partial last bar.** A snapshot taken mid-session/week/month leaves an incomplete final bar;
   `last_bar_possibly_partial` in `_manifest.json` flags it.
   Median history is ~2,400 bars, not 6,600 — filter on bar count before cross-sectional ranking.
4. **Upstream gaps and bad ticks.** Yahoo drops the odd session for individual symbols, and a small
   number of bars violate OHLC ordering. Reported by `validate_data.py`, not silently patched.
5. **Out of scope.** NSE Emerge (SME) symbols and BSE-exclusive listings are not served by Yahoo.

## Curing survivorship bias

Yahoo cannot fix this: it deletes delisted Indian tickers outright, returning zero bars even for
the years they traded (verified on AMTEKAUTO, ANDHRABANK, ALBK, ALOKTEXT). The point-in-time source
is NSE bhavcopy — the official end-of-day record of every symbol that traded on a given day.

- Legacy format, 1999 to ~2020:
  `nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/historical/EQUITIES/<YYYY>/<MON>/cm<DD><MON><YYYY>bhav.csv.zip`
- Current UDiFF format:
  `nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/cm/BhavCopy_NSE_CM_0_0_0_<YYYYMMDD>_F_0000.csv.zip`
- Rename map: `nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/equities/symbolchange.csv` (1,057 records, 1999-2026)

Stacking ~6,650 daily files reconstructs the universe as it was on each date; a company simply stops
appearing after it dies. Filter to series EQ/BE/BZ — the files also carry SGBs and ETFs.

The cost is that bhavcopy prices are **raw**: no split or bonus adjustment. Rebuilding the
equivalent of `adj_close` from NSE's corporate-actions feed is the bulk of the work, and getting it
wrong manufactures fake gaps on every split. Key on ISIN where available, since symbols are renamed
and occasionally reused.

## LESSONS

Rules accumulated from mistakes made in this repo. Add to this list — never remove — whenever a
mistake recurs.

- Yahoo Finance rejects the default `python-requests`/`curl_cffi` user agent from this environment
  (`429` / SSL reset). Always pass a `requests.Session` with a browser `User-Agent` into
  `yf.download(..., session=...)`.
- `yfinance`'s `end` parameter is **exclusive**. Add one day when the caller means "up to and
  including this date", or the last session goes missing.
- Do not accept a Yahoo range limit at face value: an explicit 1h start/end is capped at 730
  *calendar* days, but `period="730d"` returns ~730 *trading* days — roughly 50% more history.
  Probe the actual limits before writing them into the code as a constant.
- `period=` requests fail for young listings (yfinance expands them into an explicit range anchored
  at the first trade date, which then exceeds the calendar cap). Always keep a narrower start/end
  fallback for the per-symbol retry pass.
- Do not judge data coverage by raw row counts per period: early years legitimately have fewer
  symbols because most constituents had not listed yet. Compare against the symbols actually listed
  at that time instead.
- Check whether a column carries real information before shipping it. Yahoo's intraday `adj_close`
  is a verbatim copy of `close`; shipping it would invite silently wrong total-return math.
- Never read an empty `yfinance` response as "this symbol has no data". Yahoo throttles past
  ~1500 consecutive symbol requests and yfinance swallows the 429 into an empty frame, which
  looks identical to a genuine miss. Check `yfinance.shared._ERRORS` for rate-limit text before
  recording a symbol as unavailable — and never derive coverage statistics from a run that was
  throttled part-way through.
- Only record a symbol as "not carried by the provider" when the provider explicitly says so
  (Yahoo: "no timezone found" / "possibly delisted"). A transient batch failure otherwise gets
  written into the manifest as permanent absence — a whole alphabetical block of real large caps
  (SIEMENS, SJVN, SOBHA...) was once shipped as "no history on Yahoo" that way. When a failure
  cannot be classified, fail loudly and keep the checkpoints rather than publishing the gap.
- Sanity-check a "missing data" list before trusting it. Contiguous alphabetical runs, or the
  presence of household names, mean a failed request batch, not absent data.
- Checkpoint long downloads to disk per batch. A run over thousands of symbols will get
  interrupted; writing results only at the end throws away hours of completed work.
- Back off for minutes, not seconds, on a 429. Retrying hard through a rate limit extends the
  block instead of clearing it.
- Report upstream data problems; do not silently repair or drop them. A backtest built on quietly
  patched data is worse than one built on data whose flaws are documented.
- Keep large Parquet panels partitioned (by year). A single file over 100 MB is rejected by GitHub
  outright, and anything near it makes the repo painful to clone.
- Sleep between retry attempts, not after the last one — a trailing back-off multiplies wasted time
  across thousands of symbols that will never resolve.
